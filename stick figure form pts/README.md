# Stick Figure Skeleton Visualization from 2D Joint Coordinates

A Python project that generates and visualizes human stick-figure skeletons using predefined body joint coordinates. This demonstrates core concepts behind pose-based animation pipelines used in computer vision systems such as motion tracking and human pose estimation.

## 🎯 Project Description

This project simulates the fundamental representation used in pose estimation systems. Instead of detecting poses from images (which requires models like MediaPipe or OpenPose), we work directly with 2D joint coordinates to understand how skeletal structures are represented and animated in computer vision pipelines.

**Relevance to Computer Vision & Animation:**
- **Pose Estimation**: Real pose detection systems output joint coordinates similar to those used here
- **Motion Tracking**: The animation demonstrates how pose sequences create motion
- **Skeletal Animation**: Shows the foundation of character rigging in game engines and animation software
- **Data Representation**: Illustrates how human pose can be encoded as structured coordinate data

## ✨ Features

- **✓ 15-Joint Human Skeleton Model**: Anatomically structured body representation
- **✓ Realistic Skeleton Connections**: Proper bone structure connecting head, torso, arms, and legs
- **✓ Interactive Visualization**: Clean matplotlib-based rendering
- **✓ Multiple Animation Modes**:
  - Static pose visualization
  - Waving animation (arm movement)
  - Walking animation (coordinated limb motion)
- **✓ Modular Class Design**: Easy to extend and modify
- **✓ Joint Update System**: Programmatic control of individual joint positions
- **✓ Proper Proportions**: Realistic human body ratios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**: Core programming language
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization and animation framework
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations for smooth motion

## 📋 Joint Structure

The skeleton consists of 15 key joints:

```
Head & Torso: head, neck, spine_mid, left_shoulder, right_shoulder, left_hip, right_hip
Arms: left_elbow, left_wrist, right_elbow, right_wrist  
Legs: left_knee, left_ankle, right_knee, right_ankle
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd stick-figure-from-keypoints
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Program

Execute the main script:
```bash
python stick_figure.py
```

You'll see a menu with three options:
1. **Static pose** - Generates and saves `output.png`
2. **Waving animation** - Animated arm waving motion
3. **Walking animation** - Coordinated walking motion with arm swing

Simply enter your choice (1, 2, or 3) or press Enter for the default static pose.

### Expected Output

- A graphical window displaying the stick figure
- For static mode: An `output.png` file saved in the project directory
- For animations: Real-time animated motion until window is closed

## 💡 Code Overview

### Key Components

**StickFigure Class:**
- `__init__()`: Defines joint positions and skeleton connections
- `plot_skeleton()`: Renders the stick figure
- `update_joint()`: Modifies individual joint positions
- `animate_wave()`: Creates arm waving animation
- `animate_walk()`: Creates walking animation

**Coordinate System:**
- Origin (0, 0) at center
- Y-axis increases upward
- Normalized coordinates for easy scaling

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

- **Computer Vision Fundamentals**: Understanding pose representation as coordinate data
